# Roblox-Username-To-ID
This gets someone's username and displays that player's ID. This is good for knowing if someone was ID sniped or if you are lagging and want to use it for other tools.

(You need node.js for this)

# Instructions
1. Go on Command Prompt.
2. Type 'cd <em>C:\Users\... (The place you want to run the files.)</em>'
3. Type 'npm init' (then press enter and fill in what you wish)
4. Type these:
<li>
<ul>npm install --save request request-promise cheerio puppeteer</ul>
<ul>npm install prompt-sync</ul> 
</li>
5. When they have finished installing, copy <a href="https://github.com/Scripped/Roblox-Username-To-ID/blob/main/test.js"> this code</a> onto a .js document. (Don't paste this on Command Prompt, paste it to a text editor (notepad, notepad++, visual studio etc.))
6. Go back to Command Prompt and type 'node <em>filename.js</em>'
7. It will take a while, and most times it won't load -- that's how bad my coding is lol.
